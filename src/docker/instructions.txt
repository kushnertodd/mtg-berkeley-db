Deploying mtg-berkeley=db to Google Cloud

There are two instances:

- tkllc-lucy-game-design-instance-1 
Apache web server for web files
- app-bdb-inet-lookup-instance-1
Docker container for api server

First step:
- open page https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances?project=tkllc-lucy-game-design
- start instances tkllc-lucy-game-design-instance-1 and app-bdb-inet-lookup-instance-1 if not already started

For web files or if src/web files change:

- on tkllc-lucy-game-design-instance-1:
  - open ssh
  - remove files from home directory:
    $ rm *.js *.css *.html
  - upload:
    *.js
    *.css
    *.html
  - modify request.js to select the request_url to 34.106.93.238:8000 instead of localhost

->  static request_url = "http://34.106.93.238:8000";
    //static request_url = "http://localhost:8000";
	
  - run:
    $ sudo cp *.js *.css *.html /var/www/html
  - to be sure they copied okay, in /var/www/html run:
    $ for f in *.js *.css *.html; do echo $f; diff $f ~/$f; done
	(ensure the diff is clean)

For api server or if any of these files change:

- src/apps/mtg_app.cpp
- src/bdb-lib
- src/docker
- src/mtg-lib
- src/util-lib

- locally:
  - build mtg_app clean
  - in src/scripts
    + in one window run:
      $ sh mtg_app.sh
      (make sure there are no connect errors, else see section at the end)
    + in another window run:
      $ sh rm-db-samples.sh
	  $ sh ls-db-samples.sh
      (ensure src/data/db is clean)
      $ sh check.sh
	  (ensure all requests succeed)
      $ sh dump_db_samples.sh
      $ diff dump_sample.txt dump_sample_init.txt
      (make sure diff is clean)
	+ stop mtg_app.sh
  - in src/docker run:
    (start docker for windows if using)
    $ sh stop_images.sh
    $ sh remove_images.sh
	$ docker ps
    $ docker images
    (ensure images are gone)
    $ rm *db mtg_app
    $ sh build.sh
    $ sh run_api.sh
    (see container-id)
    $ docker logs --follow <container-id>
    (ensure you see 'server socket opened (3)')
    (open src/weblocalhost/mtg-home.html web page in chrome, select a user and deck to make sure is working)
	(run '$ sh stop_images.sh' is passes)
	
- on app-bdb-inet-lookup-instance-1:
 + open ssh
 + delete files in home directory:
   $ rm *db *json *sh mtg_app Dockerfile
 + upload files from src/docker to instance:
   account.db
   account_email.sdb
   account_username.sdb
   account_username_triplets.db
   bdb_databases.json
   build_api.sh
   card.db
   card_name.sdb
   card_name_triplets.db
   card_type_id.sdb
   deck_account_id.sdb
   deck_card_card_id.sdb
   deck_card.db
   deck_card_deck_id.sdb
   deck.db
   deck_name.sdb
   deck_name_triplets.db
   Dockerfile
   mtg_app
   mtg_app.sh
   remove_images.sh
   run_api.sh
   stop_images.sh
   
 + in the home directory run:
  $ sh stop_images.sh
  $ sh remove_images.sh
  $ docker ps
  $ docker images
  (ensure images are gone)
  $ sh build_api.sh
  $ sh run_api.sh
