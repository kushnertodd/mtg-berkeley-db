# Linux development tools and libraries <a id="linux-development"/>
These are instructions to prepare the Linux build environment.

## Linux development tools for Ubuntu 
To develop under native Ubuntu, 
- Install latest Ubuntu version ISO from the [Ubuntu download](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) page
- Install [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/,install) or other tool to burn the ISO to a USB formatted as FAT32
- Burn ISO to a USB and boot the new system from the USB
- Select Install Ubuntu
- Accept system updates

## Linux C++ Development Tools for Windows 10 <a id="linux-c++-development-tools"/>
To develop under Windows 10, linux development tools for Windows 10 include:
- JetBrains CLion
- WSL2 Linux distribution for Windows 10
- Windows Terminal

### JetBrains CLion <a id="jetbrains-clion"/>
[JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/#section=windows) is a free C++ IDE.
Mtg Berekeley DB is a Cmake project.
JetBrains has a 
[tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/quick-cmake-tutorial.html)
on setting up CLion for a Cmake project.

### WSL2 Linux distribution<a id="windows-10-wsl2-linux-distributions"/>
WSL2 is a native Linux running under Windows 10.
These are instructions for installing [Windows 10 WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).
WSL2 has specific [hardware requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting?source=recommendations),
including a 64-bit processor with second-level address translation (SLAT) and at least 4GB of RAM. Any new Intel Windows system should be adequate.
The command to [install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) 
WSL2 on Windows 10 with the Ubuntu distribution is:
```bash
$ wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```
To enable changing file owners & permissions, you need to add configuration options to`/etc/wsl.conf`:
```
$ sudo vi /etc/wsl.conf
[automount]
options = "metadata"
```
Add these lines to the end:
```
[automount]
options = "metadata"
```
#### Linux Distributions for WSL2
Linux development was done under Windows 10 WSL2 with 
[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview)
and
[Pengwin](https://www.whitewaterfoundry.com/), 
both of which may be obtained from the Microsoft Store.
may also be obtained from the Microsoft Store.
The instructions likely work for other types of Linux,
such as CentOS, 
or other types of Unix, 
such as MacOS, possibly with modifications.
These are [instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/use-custom-distro)
for installing other WSL2 Linux distributions.


### Windows Terminal <a id="windows-terminal-tool"/>
You likely would like to use [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal)
to develop using WSL2 Linux.
Windows Terminal may be obtained from the Microsoft Store.
This is a Microsoft [tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) for starting with Windows Terminal.
Scott Hanselman has an excellent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC-gLkYWXLw) on using Windows Terminal.

## Linux Build Tools <a id="linux-build-tools"/>
There are several Linux C++ libraries and tools required for the build.
There are some installation differences between native Ubuntu
and Windows 10 WSL2 Linux. They will be noted below.


Pengwin and Ubuntu use the`apt`command to install many Linux library and tool packages:
```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install <package>
```
Always run`apt update`before`install`.
Some packages are not available under`apt`, or some`apt`packages
have versions that are too old to use.
In those cases, they can be directly downloaded from a web site or built from source,
as indicated below.

### Linux compilers and utilities
The Linux`build-essential`package installs the C++ compiler, 
debugger, libraries, other development tools required for the build.
`build-essential`includes:
  - [g++, gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
  - [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)  

Other utilities to install are:
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)
- doxygen
- curl
- unzip
- vim  

They are installed with:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt install build-essential 
$ sudo apt install git 
$ sudo apt install openssl
$ sudo apt install libssl-dev
$ sudo apt install doxygen
$ sudo apt install curl
$ sudo apt install unzip
$ sudo apt install vim
```

### Cmake <a id="linux-cmake-tool"/>
Mtg Berkeley DB is written in C++. 
[Cmake](https://cmake.org/) is used for building C++ applications.
The build requires the latest version, currently 3.27.4.
#### Ubuntu
The latest cmake version can be installed with:
```bash
$ sudo snap install --classic cmake  
```
#### WSL
On WSL2, the version available from`apt`is too old to use, 
so it must be built from source.
Select the latest source from the`Unix/Linux Source`link on the [cmake download website](https://cmake.org/download/),
e.g.,`cmake-3.26.3.tar.gz`, 
and [build](https://cmake.org/install/) with these instructions:
```bash
$ gunzip -c cmake-3.27.0-rc4.tar.gz | tar xvf -
$ cd cmake-3.27.0
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install
```
## Linux C++ Libraries <a id="linux-c++-libraries"/>
Various C++ libraries are required for the Linux build.

### `json-c` Library <a id="linux-json-c-library"/> 
[json-c](https://github.com/json-c/json-c) is a C-based JSON manipulation library.
The following will download the latest version of`json-c`from the git repository and [build](https://github.com/json-c/json-c/blob/master/README.md)
static libraries and install them in`/usr/local`:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:json-c/json-c.git
$ git clone https://github.com/json-c/json-c.git

```
At this point, manually edit`json-c/json_util.h`to change JSON_FILE_BUF_SIZE from 4096 to 65536.
```bash
#define JSON_FILE_BUF_SIZE 65536
```
Continue the build:
```bash
$ mkdir json-c-build]
$ cd json-c-build
$ cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF ../json-c 
$ cmake --build .
$ sudo cmake --install . 
```
### Berekley DB Library <a id="linux-berkeley-db-library"/>
The [Berkeley DB](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/related/berkeleydb.html) library 
is an efficient, embedded non-SQL key-indexed database.
The latest version is required and can be built from source.
Download source for the latest version from:  
https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/related/berkeleydb-downloads.html
- Select from the Berkeley DB *version* link. You may need to create an Oracle account. 
- Select the`Linux x86-64 platform,`read accept the license agreement, and select`Download`.
- Run the downloaded Windows executable named Oracle_SSN_DLM_*nnn*.exe to create a file named V*nnnnnn-nn*.zip. 
- Select Open Destination from the opened window to find the zip.
- Right-click/drag the zip using File Explorer and select Expand into a directory named V*nnnnnn-nn*.
$ unzip V997917-01.zip

[Build](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17276_01/html/installation/build_unix.html) using these instructions.

To build, let BDB_HOME be the Berkeley DB installation directory, e.g.,V*nnnnnn-nn*/db-18.1.40:
```bash
$ unzip V997917-01.zip
$ cd db-18.1.40/build_unix
$ ../dist/configure --prefix=/usr --enable-cxx --disable-shared 
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Deploying mtg-berkeley=db to Google Cloud

There are two instances:

- tkllc-lucy-game-design-instance-1 
Apache web server for web files
- app-bdb-inet-lookup-instance-1
Docker container for api server

First step:
- open page https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances?project=tkllc-lucy-game-design
- start instances tkllc-lucy-game-design-instance-1 and app-bdb-inet-lookup-instance-1 if not already started

For web files or if src/web files change:

- on tkllc-lucy-game-design-instance-1:
  - open ssh
  - remove files from home directory:
    $ rm *.js *.css *.html
  - upload:
    *.js
    *.css
    *.html
  - modify request.js to select the request_url to 34.106.93.238:8000 instead of localhost

->  static request_url = "http://34.106.93.238:8000";
    //static request_url = "http://localhost:8000";
    
  - run:
    $ sudo cp *.js *.css *.html /var/www/html
  - to be sure they copied okay, in /var/www/html run:
    $ for f in *.js *.css *.html; do echo $f; diff $f ~/$f; done
    (ensure the diff is clean)

For api server or if any of these files change:

- src/apps/mtg_app.cpp
- src/bdb-lib
- src/docker
- src/mtg-lib
- src/util-lib

- locally:
  - build mtg_app clean
  - in src/scripts
    + in one window run:
      $ sh mtg_app.sh
      (make sure there are no connect errors, else see section at the end)
    + in another window run:
      $ sh rm-db-samples.sh
      $ sh ls-db-samples.sh
      (ensure src/data/db is clean)
      $ sh check.sh
      (ensure all requests succeed)
      $ sh dump_db_samples.sh
      $ diff dump_sample.txt dump_sample_init.txt
      (make sure diff is clean)
  - stop mtg_app.sh
  - in src/docker run:
    (start docker for windows if using)
    $ sh stop_images.sh
    $ sh remove_images.sh
    $ docker ps
    $ docker images
    (ensure images are gone)
  + note that the docker uses the data files in data/
    $ rm *db mtg_app
    $ sh build.sh
    $ sh run_api.sh
    (see container-id)
    $ docker logs --follow <container-id>
    (ensure you see 'server socket opened (3)')
    (open src/weblocalhost/mtg-home.html web page in chrome, select a user and deck to make sure is working)
    (run '$ sh stop_images.sh' is passes)
    
- on app-bdb-inet-lookup-instance-1:
 + open ssh
 + delete files in home directory:
   $ rm *db *json *sh mtg_app Dockerfile
 + if you want fresh db files, upload files from src/docker to instance:
   account.db
   account_email.sdb
   account_username.sdb
   account_username_triplets.db
   bdb_databases.json
   build_api.sh
   card.db
   card_name.sdb
   card_name_triplets.db
   card_type_id.sdb
   deck_account_id.sdb
   deck_card_card_id.sdb
   deck_card.db
   deck_card_deck_id.sdb
   deck.db
   deck_name.sdb
   deck_name_triplets.db
   Dockerfile
   mtg_app
   mtg_app.sh
   remove_images.sh
   run_api.sh
   stop_images.sh
   
 + in the home directory run:
  = first time:
    $ mkdir data
    $ cp *db data
  = if you want to start with fresh data files:
    $ cp *db data
  $ sh stop_images.sh
  $ sh remove_images.sh
  $ docker ps
  $ docker images
  (ensure images are gone)
  $ sh build_api.sh
  $ sh run_api.sh
